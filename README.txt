Hi,
Thank you for purchasing the website, I made this simple website as I see portals being released, but no player count. For more resources by me, you can find it by clicking on the resources link below.

Resources: https://www.mc-market.org/members/17370/#resources

== Configuration ==
To change the playercount, visit the /includes folder, from there, open scripts.php.

Change "play.thesquadmc.net" to your server IP.

IP:
	To change things such as the logo or IP on header block, navigate to /includes folder, then open head.php
	Change "play.thesquadmc.net" to your server IP.

Logo:
	Navigate to the /includes folder, open up head.php
	Change -> <a href="/"><img src="https://thesquadmc.net/styles/ndzn/logo.png"></a>
